## General thoughts, questions, etc.
### Should I use the template that has opt-out links?
If your email will be sent to addresses that are not university email addresses (@wustl.edu), OR if your email is not considered required communications for the recipient's affiliation with WashU (student, employee, etc), then YES you should use the Opt-Out template. This is to keep in compliance with Federal [CAN-SPAM Act](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business).

### The email I sent doesn't look quite like this template. What gives?
If you're noticing that the email you sent differs from the template, first determine if the content is all there and readable. There are thousands of combinations of operating system, app, and hardware (i.e. which model of phone, tablet, etc) that ensuring a pixel-perfect experience is impossible. Are the differences you see acceptable and accessible for differently-abled users?

If the problems with your mail are not acceptable, please [contact MarComm](https://marcomm.washu.edu/contacts).
